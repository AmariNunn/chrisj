## CHRISTOPHER JORDAN, CPT

Chris graduated from Whites Creek High School and attended Tennessee State University, majoring in Architectural Engineering. He then relocated to Everett, Washington, where he lived for the next 9 years and began his career in the communications industry.

At one point, Chris weighed 350 pounds and was diagnosed with stage 2 hypertension. Over time, he aimed to lose 100 pounds in hopes of managing his blood pressure without medication. For the next 3 years, he followed a routine of daily cardio and improved diet. As a result of these lifestyle changes, Chris now maintains a weight of 260 pounds, suitable for his 6’5” frame.

Chris started his first business years ago called Healthy Meal Prep by Chris. He prepared affordable, healthy entrees and snacks to demonstrate that eating healthy can be interesting, flavorful, and cost-effective. Chris aimed to better serve his clients by completing Certifications in Personal Training, Strength and Conditioning, and Nutrition from the International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA). In his spare time, he works out, relaxes, and spends time with his family. Chris is a long-standing member of The Temple Church in Nashville, TN.
