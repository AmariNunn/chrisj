Redesign the Jordan Wellness Experience website from scratch. The current site (https://futurevision1.netlify.app/) looks too basic and generic. The client wants something that feels elevated, luxurious, boutique, and modern — not cookie-cutter clinic. Think high-end private wellness studio, concierge-level care, editorial elegance. This site will be deployed on Netlify.

DESIGN OVERHAUL DIRECTION:
The current site looks like a standard template medical site. Blow it up. The new design should feel like:

A luxury wellness brand — think Equinox, Alo Yoga, or a high-end med spa website
Clean but NOT boring. Elegant but NOT stuffy. Warm but NOT clinical.
Generous white space, beautiful typography, refined color palette
Large cinematic imagery — photos should breathe and fill the screen
Smooth scroll animations, subtle parallax, fade-ins — the site should feel alive and fluid
Typography hierarchy matters: use a refined serif or elegant sans-serif for headings, clean sans-serif for body text. Think editorial magazine quality.
Color palette suggestion: crisp white backgrounds, warm neutrals (soft beige, warm gray, taupe), with a rich accent color — deep gold, muted sage green, or warm bronze — to convey premium quality. NO harsh clinical blues or reds.
Buttons and CTAs should feel tactile and premium — soft rounded corners, subtle hover transitions, not flat generic rectangles
The overall feel should make someone think "this is a private, exclusive wellness experience" the moment the page loads


NAVIGATION MENU:
Include the following items in the navigation:

Home
About
Services
New Patient Forms
Testimonials
Book Appointment
Contact


HOME PAGE:
Background: WHITE — clean white background is important so photos display clearly.
Hero Section:

Large, cinematic hero area
Business name: Jordan Wellness Experience
Tagline: Where Clinical Precision Meets Lifelong Wellness
Remove ALL other words, paragraphs, star ratings, review counts, etc. from the hero — keep it clean with just the name, tagline, and two buttons
Two CTA buttons: Book Appointment | View Services
Remove any "Taking New Patients" text
Add a scrolling banner/marquee across the screen that says "Now Accepting New Patients" — this should be a sleek, animated ribbon-style banner that scrolls continuously. Style it elegantly — not cheap or flashy, think refined ticker. Could be placed just below the hero or as an overlay strip.

Location & Hours:

Keep the location and "Open Daily By Appointment" info — display it cleanly
Location: 3228 Clarksville Pike, Suite 101, Nashville, TN 37218
Hours: By Appointment Only — 11am to 2pm and 4pm to 7pm, Sunday – Saturday
Phone: 615-434-4328

Photo Slideshow:

Create a beautiful slideshow with 10 image slots
Each slide should display for approximately 3 seconds
The slideshow should loop continuously as long as someone is on the Home page
Smooth transitions between slides (fade or soft slide — nothing jarring)
Use clearly labeled placeholder images for each slot with these descriptions so the client knows which photos to upload:

"Photo 1: Dr. Cox-Jordan in pink shirt — side posture adjustment on male patient in black shirt and jeans"
"Photo 2: Dr. Cox-Jordan in all black — adjusting seated woman's neck (black jacket, blue shirt, blue/white skirt)"
"Photo 3: Chris in wellness studio — black t-shirt and black hat showing weights to a couple"
"Photo 4: Two women in wellness studio with backs turned — one on treadmill, one on exercise bike"
"Photo 5: Dr. Cox-Jordan in light blue blouse standing beside patient in massage chair (patient in light green sweatshirt, grey sweatpants)"
"Photo 6: Dr. Cox-Jordan in red top — using theragun on male patient's upper back (patient in red t-shirt)"
"Photo 7: Dr. Cox-Jordan adjusting a child — both sitting on black table, silver instrument to child's upper back (child in blue shirt, black pants)"
"Photo 8: Chris in wellness studio — black t-shirt and hat showing a woman how to use weights"
"Photo 9: Woman standing in red half top with tattoos — getting a fat freezing session"
"Photo 10: Dr. Cox-Jordan measuring a patient's arm"


Make it very easy for the client to swap in real photos later (clear file naming convention or CMS-style image slots)

Wellness Branding Section (replaces the old Private Wellness Setting / Intentional Care / Whole Body Approach boxes):

REMOVE the old three-box layout entirely
Replace with an elegant branding section that incorporates these phrases — display them in a visually striking way (large typography, staggered layout, editorial style, or as an elegant grid of statements):

"Where precision care meets elevated living."
"Wellness, refined."
"Private care. Exceptional outcomes."
"Because your body deserves concierge-level care."
"Restore. Strengthen. Elevate. Enhance."
"Experience care without compromise."
"An experience reserved for the discerning."


These could be displayed as a large typographic section with alternating sizes, or as elegant cards, or as a flowing editorial layout — get creative but keep it premium feeling

About / Studio Description Section:

Include a photo spot for Chris and Dr. Cox-Jordan together (placeholder labeled "Photo: Chris & Dr. Cox-Jordan")
